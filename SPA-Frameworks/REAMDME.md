SPA Frameworks - Summary
# Overview

1. ## Single Page Applications (SPA)
SPAs use a single web page for the entire application.
JavaScript is used to modify the view.
Data can be fetched from the server using Ajax or websockets.
Navigation within the application is handled by JavaScript.
By default, the same URL is used for all application states, but routers can manage multiple URLs.

2. ## Why Frameworks?
- Frameworks offer tried and tested tools for building scalable, interactive web applications.
- They are especially useful for developing single page applications.
- Frameworks help ensure compatibility across different browser versions.

3. ## Multi-Page Applications (MPA)
- Traditional web applications where the browser loads a new page from the server on user navigation (e.g., clicking links or submitting forms).
- Each page has a unique URL.
- Requires a network request to load new pages.

4. ## Benefits and Drawbacks of SPAs
- Benefits include improved user experience, capability to work offline, and smoother development.
- Drawbacks include challenges with search engine optimization, large initial download size, and the need for custom loading states and error messages.

5. ## Frameworks vs. Vanilla JavaScript
- Frameworks provide reusable components, a template system, state-view synchronization, and routing.
- Vanilla JavaScript is capable of achieving similar results but may require a newer web browser.

6. ## Types of Frameworks
- Client-side frameworks: These libraries run in the web browser and include React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, and Ember.
- Static Site Generators (SSG): They build static pages in advance and do not depend on data from requests (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll).
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Traditional approach where views are generated on the server per request.

7. ## Choosing a Framework
- React remains one of the most used frameworks, with Vue gaining popularity.
- It's essential to learn Vanilla JavaScript first to avoid framework dependency and keep up with evolving technologies.
